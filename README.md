# Animals_Zoo
# This is a program named "Zoo" that allows the user to view different animals in the zoo. 
It will display a menu of different categories of animals (mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, etc.). 
The user will be able to select a category and then an animal from that category. 
The program will then display the ASCII art for that animal. 

ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from individual characters.

# You may contribute to this program by adding more animals and ASCII art for those animals.
